10 rem    Use a sentinel controlled loop to input 10 integers,
20 rem    compute and print their sum (s)
21 rem
22 rem    set sum (s) to 0
30 let s = 0
31 rem
32 rem    Input a number into a, if it is a sentinel value (less than zero)
33 rem    then print out the result, else add it to the sum and continue
34 rem    inputting numbers
40 input a
50 if a < 0 goto 80
60 let s = s + a 
70 goto 30
71 rem
72 rem    print out the result and quit
80 print s
90 end
